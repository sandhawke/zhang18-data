International aid agencies said thousands of villages have been cut off by flooding with people being deprived of food and clean water for days.  South Asia suffers from frequent flooding during the monsoon season, which lasts from June to September, but authorities have said this year's floods have been much worse. ",

This isn't an uncommon practice; most flu vaccines pass inspection every year.

The ingredient that is getting the most flack is called an adjuvant. The particular one involved is called Squalene, and it has been linked to auto-immune disease side effects. In fact, it may have been used during chemical attacks in the Gulf War. Symptoms include chronic fatigue, muscle aches, and neurologic damage.

Over 150 million citizens in the U.S. are consuming medications that are tests or even unproven products.
